Hello! This repository is for the Probability and Applied Statistics course in Fall 2023.

Currently has three main folders:

- ***Programming_Assignments***: Contains programming assignments -- *MontyHall*, *Cars_CSV* (+ excel with data and graph), *Birthday Checker*, and *Hands*.

Will be adding:
- ***StatsLibrary*** folder: contains *programs of formulas* through the first few weeks of the semester + *formula sheet*. Separated into chapters 1-3.
- Files to ***Github_Assignment*** folder.
- Attempt at ***Hands*** assignment.
